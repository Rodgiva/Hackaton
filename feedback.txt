Avigdor Partouche: A gladiator game with pygame
Your project is amazing! Not only is the game fun and well-designed, but your code is also simple to follow despite its complexity. 
This means you did a really good job!
The only thing I would suggest you consider as a bonus is to make it even better by dividing the class Game into other inherited classes like Settings, Moves, etc. 
This is because the main.py file is quite long, which makes it complicated to follow.
I am so happy that you used all the concepts we've learned in class with such mastery!
